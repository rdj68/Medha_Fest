                “ Amrutvahini Sheti & Shikshan Vikas Santha is a premier
                institution in the educational field in Maharashtra. It
                efficiently and most qualitatively runs mainly technical and
                professional courses; and is well- known on the state and
                national level for its highest academic standard. This
                institution organises a grand cultural festival known as 'MEDHA'
                every year from 2016. Medha connotes intelligence. This is
                perhaps the second largest cultural festival in the state, the
                first being The Malhar Festival, Mumbai. The thought of
                organising such a grand festival on Amrutvahini was
                conceptualised by Rajwardhan Thorat; and it was successfully
                materialised by the Sanstha under the guidance of Mrs. Sharayu
                Deshmukh - Trustee of the Institution. ‘Medha’ provides an
                opportunity to the enthusiastic youth to showcase their hidden
                talents & skills. More than 10,000 students and nearly double
                number of parents whole heartedly enjoy this festival every
                year.
